# Final Documentation

## Due at final exam period:
* README.md
* Flowchart
* Code - fully commented!
* Presentation

## README.md
This is general information about your game. At a minimum, it should include:
* A description of your game (around 1 paragraph should be good)
* Citations of your sources
* Anything else the user should know about your game
* Links to any files that are not stored on GitHub, but which are relevant to my grading of your game. I will not go searching through shared files on Google Drive for your work

## Flowchart
* May be created digitaly or by hand
* Should depict how the code runs
* If you need help, see me

## Code
* Remember to comment your code
* Each function and class should have a docstring as the first line of the block of code to describe what it does. For simple functions, this docstring is likely to be adequate commenting.

## Presentation
* 3-5 minutes
* Must have visuals
* Areas to cover are: Demonstrating the game, your favorite feature/what you're most proud of, and what you figured out in the process
* Your class will have a chance to ask questions
