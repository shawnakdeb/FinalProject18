# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2017

## Goal

Plan, code, document, and present a game in Python. If you would like to incorporate graphics of some sort, please talk to me so I can get you set up.

## Criteria

Excellent work will include:

* Clean, well-written, effective code
* Version control in Git
* Clear documentation of how the code works
* A presentation of the game and of the process of creating it
* Citations (MLA format) of the resources you used.

## Expectations

### General

* This is intended as an individual project. You may help each other, but you are responsible for your own work
* I am willing to consider partnerships, but you must see me ASAP for permission.
* You may (and are encouraged to) use resources you find online, but may not outright copy somebody else's work
* Your work should challenge you, but be achievable

### Code

* Your code should make effective use of classes/objects
* Your code should be well documented with comments and appropriate naming schemes
* Your code should be managed through Git. I will not require branching, but as you reach good checkpoints, you should commit your changes.
* Your code should be as free of bugs as you can manage
